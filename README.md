# download_hmp_data

This bash script aims to download data from hmp portal (https://portal.hmpdacc.org/search/s?facetTab=cases). Although the presense of tools to download data from this website like hmp client or portal client (https://github.com/michbur/hmp_client) or (https://github.com/IGS/portal_client), they does not work with me for some files. So, I made this simple script to work around it. And you can use in case it that the main tools does not work with you also.

## Usage

First, after you get your manifest file from the (https://portal.hmpdacc.org/search/s?facetTab=cases), put it in the same directory of the script and run this python script.

```python
./python download_urls.py -i example_manifest.tsv

```
